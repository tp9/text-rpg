## Welcome to the New Text-RPG

# Please read before contributing

The main game code can be found under  the '_/asses/js/_' folder.
Everything is brought together in '_main.js_' so there will never be much code in there.

When writing your code please keep in mind that this is a _community project_ and that you should make your code
readable by others, so do things like **comment your code** and **don't use random names for variables**.

## Have fun!
